python main.py <targets> [-p PORT] [-t TIMEOUT]

Options

    <targets>: List of IP addresses, domain names, file paths containing IP addresses, or CIDR network ranges.
    -p, --port PORT: Port number to check (default: 22).
    -t, --timeout TIMEOUT: Connection timeout in seconds (default: 1 second).
